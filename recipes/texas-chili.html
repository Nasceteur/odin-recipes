    <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped chipotle pepper in adobo sauce (about 2 peppers).</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of canola oil.</li>
    <li>4 lbs (1.81 kg) of boneless beef chuck roast, trimmed of excess fat, cut into 3/4-inch (2 cm) cubes.</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons of kosher salt.</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper.</li>
    <li>1 small chopped yellow onion.</li>
    <li>3 garlic cloves, minced.</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of ground cumin.</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups of water, divided</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of masa harina</li>
    <li>4 cups of beef stock</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon white vinegar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon dark brown sugar</li>
    <li>sour cream for serving, to taste</li>
    <li>1 lime, cut into wedged for serving</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients</li>

    <li>Place peppers in a large skillet and heat over medium-low heat; cook, turning once, until it's lightly toasted and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer chiles to a bowl and cover it with hot water; let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>

    <li>Drain chiles, reserving about 172 cup fo the soaking water. Use a paring knife to slice open each pepper, and remove and discard stems and seeds by running under a gentle stream of tap water</li>

    <li>Combine chiles, chipotle pepper, and reserved 1/2 cup water in a blender; blend until a smooth paste forms, 15 to 30 seconds. Set aside.</li>
    
    <li>Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Toss beef cubes in a large bowl with salt and pepper until evenly coated. Add half of the beef to the Dutch oven and cook, stirring occasionally to brown most sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a large plate. Repeat with remaining beef.</li>

    <li>Add onions and garlic to drippings in Dutch oven and cook, stirring constantly, until soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add cumin and cinnamon, and cook, stirring constantly, until darkened and fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>

    <li>Add blended chili paste and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.</li>
    
    <li>Add 1/4 cup of the water and masa harina, whisking until incorporated to avoid lumps. Add stock and remaining 1 1/4 cups water and stir to combine</li>

    <li>Add bay leaves and reserved beef and bring to a simmer over medium-high. Reduce heat to maintain a very low simmer and cook, partially covered, stirring occasionally, until liquid is thickened, about 2 hours. Stir in brown sugar and vinegar.</li>
    
    <li>Remove from heat and let stand of 20 minutes before serving warm with sour cream and lime wedges.</li>
  </ol>
